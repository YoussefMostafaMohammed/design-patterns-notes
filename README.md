# Design Patterns

Welcome to **modern-cpp-notes**—a living notebook of Modern C++, covering design patterns, smart pointers, templates, OOP internals, and everything in between.

The goal of this repository is not to list every design pattern that exists—instead, it focuses on a curated selection of the most important ones. Each pattern is explained with clear descriptions and sample implementations, giving you a practical understanding of how and when to use them in Modern C++.

## 📚 Table of Contents
