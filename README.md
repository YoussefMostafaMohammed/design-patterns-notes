# Design Patterns

This repository contains practical examples of **classic design patterns**.
Each design pattern has its own folder with explanations and example code demonstrating how to apply the pattern in real-world scenarios.

## Table of Contents

| Pattern                     | Description                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Strategy**                | Encapsulate interchangeable behaviors and decide at runtime which behavior to execute                  |
| **Abstract Factory**        | Provide an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying concrete classes      |
| **Factory Method**          | Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate       |
| **Adapter**                 | Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect                                 |
| **Proxy**                   | Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access or add functionality           |
| **Iterator**                | Access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation            |
| **Observer**                | Define a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified |
| **Decorator**               | Dynamically add responsibilities to objects without modifying their code                               |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Pass a request along a chain of handlers; each handler decides whether to process it or pass it along  |
| **Singleton**               | Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it                        |
